## Installation
1. Download the lateset APK file from the [releases page](https://github.com/ryangwsimmons/WAMobile/releases) to your android device

2. If you haven't already, enable apps from unknown sources in settings (you can google how to do this if you don't know how)

3. Open the APK file to install the app on your device.


## To-Do
- Make more WebAdvisor features available in the app (schedules, financial account, etc.)
- Handle WebAdvisor login time-outs
- Add app to the Play Store

## A Warning
This app is unofficial. The developer of WAMobile (me) is not associated with the University of Guelph in any way, apart from being a student. By entering your single sign-on credentials into third-party apps, you potentially put yourself at risk for phishing attacks. This app is entirely open source, and makes no external network calls, except for those necessary to access WebAdvisor itself. All data processing is done on-device. I believe it to be completely safe, but this is a risk you take on if you choose to use it, or any other third-party applications.
